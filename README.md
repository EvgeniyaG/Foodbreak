Foodborne Disease Outbreaks, 1998-2015
Context
Next time you take a bite, consider this: roughly one in six (or 48 million) people in the United States get sick from eating contaminated food per year. More than 250 pathogens and toxins have been known to cause foodborne illness and almost all of them can cause an outbreak.

A foodborne disease outbreak occurs when two or more people get the same illness from the same contaminated food or drink. While most foodborne illnesses are not part of a recognized outbreak, outbreaks provide important information on how germs spread, which foods cause illness, and how to prevent infection.

Public health agencies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and Freely Associated States have primary responsibility for identifying and investigating outbreaks and use a standard form to report outbreaks voluntarily to CDC. During 1998â€“2008, reporting was made through the electronic Foodborne Outbreak Reporting System (eFORS).

Content
This dataset provides data on foodborne disease outbreaks reported to CDC from 1998 through 2015. Data fields include year, state (outbreaks occurring in more than one state are listed as "multistate"), location where the food was prepared, reported food vehicle and contaminated ingredient, etiology (the pathogen, toxin, or chemical that caused the illnesses), status (whether the etiology was confirmed or suspected), total illnesses, hospitalizations, and fatalities. In many outbreak investigations, a specific food vehicle is not identified; for these outbreaks, the food vehicle variable is blank.

Are foodborne disease outbreaks increasing or decreasing? What contaminant has been responsible for the most illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths? What location for food preparation poses the greatest risk of foodborne illness?
